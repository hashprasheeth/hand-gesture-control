# Hand Gesture Control using Raspberry PI for Media Playback

Hand gesture control using Raspberry Pi for media playback offers a hands-free and intuitive way to interact with media devices. 
By leveraging the Raspberry Pi's capabilities and integrating a camera module, users can control media playback with simple hand gestures.

### Materials Required: Rpi-4, PI-Camera Module, SD Card installed with Buster OS (Debian-10 version), Ethernet cable, USB C-Type

### Softwares Required: Opencv-Contrib-Python, PyAutoGUI, Mediapipe

## Features
Hands-Free Interaction: Users can control media playback without the need for physical input devices, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

Intuitive Gestures: Simple hand gestures such as swiping, pointing, or making specific hand shapes can be used to perform actions like play, pause, volume adjustment, and skip.

Real-Time Recognition: The system employs real-time image processing and machine learning to recognize hand gestures instantly, providing responsive control over media playback.

## Gestures
1) Open hand - Play
2) Closed Fist - Pause
3) Index finger moving right- Fast Forward
4) Index finger moving left - Backwards
5) Two fingers moving up - Volume Increase
6) Two fingers moving down - Volume Decrease
